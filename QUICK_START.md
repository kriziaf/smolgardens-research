# Seedscore - Impact Assessment System — Complete Package Instructions

## 📋 What You Have

A complete, production-ready system for measuring and publishing the **Human**, **Systems**, and **Environmental Impact** of AI-assisted work.

### The Core Problem

Organizations building with AI often ask:
- **"Is this actually beneficial for our team?"** (Human Impact)
- **"Is this sustainable and resilient?"** (Systems Impact)
- **"What's the environmental cost?"** (Environmental Impact)

Existing frameworks don't adequately address all three dimensions together, and there's no standard way to compare impact across projects and organizations.

### The Solution

A **15-question scorecard** that generates comparable, publishable impact assessments. Think of it like:
- **A sustainability report** for AI projects
- **A risk assessment** for vendor dependency
- **A skills audit** for team capabilities
- **A carbon footprint** with human-workflow comparison

## 📊 The Assessment at a Glance

### 13 Questions, 3 Pillars

**Human Impact (5 questions)**
- Core purpose alignment
- Labor & skills uplift
- Reusability by others
- Cognitive sovereignty (users in control)
- Collaboration & fairness

**Systems Impact (5 questions)**
- Speed vs. cost tradeoff
- Quality & trust
- Vendor lock-in risk
- Environmental resource use
- System resilience & maintainability

**Environment (3 questions)**
- Model efficiency
- Impact tracking
- Comparison to human workflow

### Scoring: 0–2.0 per pillar
- **0 = Not Met** (concern)
- **1 = Partially Met** (progress)
- **2 = Fully Met** (strong alignment)

### Output: Three-Pillar Scorecard
```
Human:        1.4/2.0  ✓ Good
Systems:      0.8/2.0  ⚠ Needs work (vendor lock-in)
Environment:  0.7/2.0  ⚠ Needs work (improve measurement)
Overall:      1.0/2.0
```

## 🔬 Example: Real Project Assessment

**Project:** Content Generation Pipeline
- LLM: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- API Calls (30 days): 1,500
- Team: 3 people
- Duration: 30 days
- Outcome: 50% faster content, better consistency

**Scores:**
```
Human:        1.4   (well-aligned, but training needed)
Systems:      0.8   (moderate, but vendor risk)
Environment:  0.7   (saves 96× CO₂ vs. manual work!)
```

**Key Finding:** AI approach is much greener than human labor, but team needs more training on interpreting outputs.

---

## 🌍 Environmental Metrics

The tool estimates CO₂ footprint using:
- Inference call count
- Average tokens per call (~1,200)
- Model-specific emissions (pre-loaded for Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)

**Example:**
```
1,500 calls × 1,200 tokens × 0.0000138 kg CO₂/token ÷ 1,000 = 0.025 kg CO₂

vs. Human alternative:
3 people × 30 days × 8 hours × 0.02 kg CO₂/hour = 2.4 kg CO₂

AI is 96× more efficient!
```

## 🔧 How to Customize

### Add Your Own Questions
Edit the `questions` array in the HTML:
```javascript
const questions = [
  {
    id: 'myq1',
    category: 'human',  // or 'systems' or 'environment'
    title: 'Your question here?',
    context: 'Why it matters...',
    options: [
      { value: 0, label: 'Not Met', desc: '...' },
      { value: 1, label: 'Partially Met', desc: '...' },
      { value: 2, label: 'Fully Met', desc: '...' }
    ]
  }
];
```

### Weight Pillars Differently
Change the overall calculation:
```javascript
// Default: equal weight
overallScore = (human + systems + environment) / 3;

// Custom: Environment matters most (50%)
overallScore = (human × 0.25) + (systems × 0.25) + (environment × 0.5);
```

### Add LLM-Specific Emissions Data
```javascript
const emissionsData = {
  'Claude 3.5 Sonnet': 0.0000138,
  'GPT-4': 0.0000195,
  'Your Custom Model': 0.000012,
};
```

## 📚 What to Do With Your Results

### Internally
1. Share the JSON report with stakeholders
2. Track scores over time (quarterly reassessments)
3. Identify trends (are we improving on human agency?)
4. Set organizational thresholds (e.g., "must score ≥1.0 before launch")

### Externally (Contribute to Community)
1. Export your reports as JSON
2. Upload to a public GitHub repo (e.g., `ai-impact-reports`)
3. Add metadata: industry, project type, outcomes
4. Link to this methodology so others can replicate
5. Share findings in blog posts, papers, or conferences

### For Research
Aggregate anonymized assessments to:
- Identify which dimensions are most commonly weak
- Find best practices in high-scoring projects
- Benchmark by industry/model/company size
- Inform policy & governance

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a server?**
A: No. The HTML tool runs entirely in your browser. No login, no cloud required.

**Q: Can I customize the questions?**
A: Yes. Edit the HTML `questions` array. Keep the standard 13 for comparability.

**Q: How do I compare scores with other projects?**
A: Export the JSON and build a simple dashboard. The `DATA_SCHEMA.json` defines the format.

**Q: Should every AI project be assessed?**
A: Recommend assessing all "significant" AI projects (>$1k cost, >10 team hours, customer-facing, new vendor).

**Q: Can I integrate this with my existing tools?**
A: Yes. The data schema is straightforward JSON. APIs, bots, and integrations can consume it.

**Q: How accurate are the environmental estimates?**
A: Rough but useful for comparison. For precise measurement, integrate Code Carbon.

## 🎓 Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Human Impact** | Does AI strengthen or weaken the team? | Team learns more about AI outputs (good) vs. blindly trusts them (bad) |
| **Systems Impact** | Is the architecture sustainable? | Multi-vendor architecture (resilient) vs. single vendor (fragile) |
| **Environment** | What's the carbon footprint? | AI uses 96× less energy than human work (very good) |
| **Cognitive Sovereignty** | Users understand & critique outputs | Team debates AI decisions vs. auto-accepts them |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Dependency on single provider | Easy to switch models (good) vs. hard to migrate (bad) |
| **Reusability** | Can others use this work? | Open, documented, easy to adopt vs. proprietary, bespoke |
| **Systemic Fragility** | How easily does the system break? | Well-designed, tested vs. brittle, hard to maintain |
